## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to an Extensible Syntax framework! 🎉

Imagine a world where you can bend the syntax of C/C++ to your will—no limits, just pure creative freedom. That's what we're building here. This framework is designed to be an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) preprocessor for C/C++ that empowers developers to create and use powerful syntax extensions.

⚠️ **Heads up**: We're still in the early stages. That means the documentation, usage instructions, and tests are on their way. Stay tuned!

## ✨ Features

- **Limitless Extensibility**: Create custom syntax extensions for C/C++ without boundaries.
- **AST Preprocessing**: Dive deep into the AST of your C/C++ code and manipulate it to fit your needs.
- **Developer Freedom**: Whether you want to tweak the syntax or overhaul it completely, the choice is yours.
